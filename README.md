Code for Advanced Risk and Portfolio Management Certificate

This repo contains the code I wrote for completing the ARPM Practical Project (https://www.arpm.co/certificate/testing/project/), which is required by the ARPM certificate. The code depicts the important steps invovled in a quantitative risk and portfolio management process on a miniature example.
